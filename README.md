I am a full-stack junior developer who has recently completed a 16-week intensive software development boot camp at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy). I am looking for a junior role at a company that will help expand and consolidate my programming knowledge.
Before Makers, I studied Psychology at the University of Surrey with a placement year at anxiety & depression therapy services.

**Team Player & Communicator**

- At Makers, I was part of several group projects where I had the opportunity to develop Agile/Scrum & XP values. I also had the pleasure of pair programming with someone new every day, which gave me the chance to learn how to cooperate and adapt to the individual pairing styles of my partners.
- I enjoy and regularly partake in team sports, managing and captaining a small football team in a competitive 6-a-side league. I was able to demonstrate leadership, communication and encouragement and resilience when facing challenging opponents.

**Fast Learner**

- Able to pick up new languages/frameworks quickly alongside continuously integrating code as part of a team. For my final project, I learnt to use Swift to develop a functioning iOS application that was ready to present within 10 days.
- In my spare time, I challenge myself to learn new skills in music such as playing the guitar and DJing.

**Data-Driven**

- At iCope, I was able to quickly learn how to operate the NHS systems and Databases which allowed me to analyse GP referral rates and therapist/treatment success rates. I reported these findings to the team which then allowed for an informed decision on whether to purchase certain treatment licences.
- Average of 70% in Statistics and Data Analysis university modules and 68% in my Dissertation.
